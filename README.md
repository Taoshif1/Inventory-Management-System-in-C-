# 🧮 Inventory Management System in C

This is my **first full project in DS in C language**, built with dedication, late nights and a whole lot of problem-solving.  
As a CSE student with a passion for tech and business, I wanted to create something **practical**, **real-life usable** and **code-rich** — so I made this **Inventory Management System** using only **pure C**.

This project is designed to help **shopkeepers, small business owners or students** who want to manage products, stock and sales in a simple way through a terminal-based system (might add GUI later if needed).

## ⚙️ How It Works

This project uses:
- **C Language** for logic  
- **File Handling** to save/load inventory  
- **Structs & Arrays** for data management  
- **Menu-driven console UI** for ease of use  

---

## 💥 The Full Journey (A to Z)

When I started this project, I just had an idea: “Let’s try making something useful using only C.”  
I knew a little about structs and basic file handling but managing real-world problems was **super challenging and i enjoyed till the last second**.

### 🔍 Problems I Faced:

- Making data **persistent** using file save/load (struct to file and back)
- Implementing **search**, **filter** and **update** functionalities without advanced data structures
- Figuring out how to **sort the array** of structs by quantity
- Dealing with **logical bugs** like:
  - selling more items than available
  - wrong index deletion
  - wrong data being updated
- Making the UI intuitive with a menu so users don’t get lost
- Avoiding crashes due to array overflow or file read errors
- Balancing between **clean code** and **fast development**

But with **dedication**, **Googling**, **debugging** and **love for the grind**, Glad I pushed through.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Real use of **structs**, **arrays** and **functions**
- How to manage **data flow** between runtime and files like a pro
- The difference between **temporary output** and **permanent storage**
- The joy of building something useful from scratch 🧑‍💻🔥

## 🔮 Future Plans

- Add **login system** with username & password  
- Export data to **CSV or Excel**  
- Add **auto item ID system**  
- Turn this into a **GUI-based desktop app** (maybe using Python or Java)  
- Build a **web version** in the future
